The purpose of the Black Sky Charter is to hold ultimate authority. Without a charter, no person has power, and no action has legality. The Charter will delegate authority through the means of Stances. 

A Stance is a guild goal, manifested in the form of legal authority. A Stance includes a description of the Guild's goal, who is responsible for actualizing the goal, and what powers are delegated to responsible party. 

The Stances will be bound in three Tomes: the Covenant of Moral Authority, the Tome of Board Stances, and the Tome of Guild Stances. 

The Covenant of Moral Authority lists Stances assigned to all mankind by the powers unseen. They are made to guide the creation of all other Stances, and can even be invoked to supersede lower Stances. 

The Tome of Chairman Stances contains Stances that represent core Guild Mission. All primary Stances of sensitivity are bound in the Tome of Chairman Stances. All Chairmen and Board Members will have the right to read from the Tome of Chairman Stances, and can use it to derive power and make decisions. For all Guild Members to be affected by a Stance in this Tome, it must have a derivative Stance in the Tome of Guild Stances. Chairman and Board Members are to make all decisions based off of Chairman Stances. 

The Tome of Guild Stances binds all of our public Stances. We may share these with our allies and our enemies. It is what defines the identity of the Guild. Guild Members are to make all decisions based of Guild Stances, unless otherwise directed by a Board Member invoking a Chairman Stance.
## The Form of a Stance
A stance will contain the following sections:
1. Title
2. Goal
3. Responsibilities
### Title
A title is suggested so that the Stance may be more easily invoked. This title is suggested to not be related to the Stance. This is even more crucial for Board Stances.
### Goal
The goal is meant to describe what the Guild hopes to achieve by assuming this Stance. It should be descriptive and thorough. The goal will be invoked when the Guild is faced with a decision. Thus through a goal, any Guildmember may make a decision on behalf of the Guild.
### Responsibilities
The responsibilities are given to certain individuals to carry out a Stance. They may may describe more specific forms of authority, and to whom this authority is designated. All authorities given may only be used to carry out the Stance's goal.
## Ratification of Stance 
For a Stance to be bound in the Tomes of Stances, it must first be ratified. A chairman that has been granted jurisdiction over a field may present a Stance from that field. They are responsible for documenting the Stance and presenting it to the Board. 

Once presented, the Stance will be voted on. If the Stance is a Guild Stance, all the Guild has the right to vote. If the Stance is a Board Stance, all of the Board has the right to vote. The Chairman does not vote on their own Stance. A Stance needs a majority of the vote to pass. If the votes are equal, the presenting Chairman will break the tie. 

If a Stance is brought up under the jurisdiction of another Chairman, the Chairman may veto the Stance. The veto may be overturned with three quarters of the voters. If the jurisdiction is disputed, the Operations Chair must present a Stance further defining the jurisdiction.

## Designation of the Chairmen
### Chairman of the Operations Branch
### Chairman of Trade Branch
### Chairman of Research Branch
### Chairman of Expansion
## Recourse of a Stanceless Decision
Should a decision need to be made, and a Stance is not available, the course of action taken depends upon the urgency of the action. 

If there is time for multiple Chairman to convene, a quick decision can be made in the field. The Chairman with jurisdiction should lead the discussion, and ensure the decision benefits their field. The decision will be a majority vote. 

If there is no time for the Chairmen to convene, the Chair of Operations will make the decision of how to proceed. If the Chair of Operations is not present, another Board member may make the decision. 

All decisions made from these actions will be resolved formally as a Stance at a later date. The outcome of the Stance will not necessarily be the same as the decision.
## Revocation of a Stance
A stance can be brought to vote for revocation by either the chairman with jurisdiction, or by a petition backed by half of the active guildmembers able to view the stance. 

When the stance is brought to vote, if the vote is backed by the chairman with jurisdiction, the vote only requires one quarter of the vote. If the chairman is against the vote, it requires three quarters of the vote to be revoked.
